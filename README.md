## Project Description

This is a web application built using React and Vite that includes three main features:

1. **Authentication**: Users can register, log in, reset their passwords using an OTP sent to their email, and update their passwords.  
2. **Task Management**: A task board with features for creating, dragging and dropping tasks between columns (Pending, Completed, Done), and deleting tasks.  
3. **Feed Section**: A feed where users can post content, including photos and captions. Users can view all posts, delete their own posts, and store/retrieve photos using Cloudinary.

- **Register**: Users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password.
- **Login**: Users can log in using their email and password.
- **Forgot Password**: Allows users to reset their password by:

### Task Management
- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by filling out a form with a task name and description.
